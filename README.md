# NLP_Final_Project_News_Headline
 This project aims to create a system using NLTK to generate news headlines. It will preprocess articles with sentence splitting, tokenization, POS tagging, and NER to extract key information, then evaluate the generated headlines against actual ones using cosine similarity for relevance.
